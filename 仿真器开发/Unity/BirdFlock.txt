Readme 文件中的介绍如下：BirdFlock is a real-time 3D visual simulation of birds’ group behavior created in C# and Unity 3D. Virtual birds, like real ones, gather in flocks, avoid collisions with obstacles and with other birds, fly to attraction point, etc. Algorithm demonstrates “natural” behavior of flock in three different environments: flight along predefined points, behavior in a confined space and flight without aims and obstacles.
